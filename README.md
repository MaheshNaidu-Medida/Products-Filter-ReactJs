#### Add Functionality

The app must have the following functionalities

- When an authenticated user opens the Products Route then an HTTP GET request should be made to **productsApiUrl** with query parameters `title_search`, `category` and `rating` with initial values as **empty strings**.
- When a value is entered in the Search Input and the `Enter` button is clicked
    - Make an HTTP GET request to the URL productsApiUrl with `jwt_token` in the Cookies and query parameter `title_search` with value as the text entered in the Search Input
    - Display _loader_ while fetching the response
    - After the data is fetched successfully, display the list of products received in the response
- When a **Category** is clicked
    - Make an HTTP GET request to the URL **productsApiUrl** with `jwt_token` in the Cookies and query parameter `category` with value as the id of the category clicked
    - Display _loader_ while fetching the response
    - After the data is fetched successfully, display the list of products received in the response
- When a **Rating** is clicked
    - Make an HTTP GET request to the URL **productsApiUrl** with `jwt_token` in the Cookies and query parameter `rating` with value as the id of the rating clicked
    - Display _loader_ while fetching the response
    - After the data is fetched successfully, display the list of products received in the response
- When the **Clear Filters** button is clicked
    - All the filters applied should be reset to initial values
    - Make an HTTP GET request to the URL **productsApiUrl** with`jwt_token` in the Cookies and without any filters
    - Display _loader_ while fetching the response
    - After the data is fetched successfully, display the list of products received in the response
- When multiple filters are applied, then HTTP GET request should be made with all the filters that are applied
    - For example: When the **Electronics** Category is clicked and rating **4 and above** is clicked the the **productsApiUrl** will be as follows
        
    ``` js
const apiUrl = 'https://apis.ccbp.in/products?sort_by=PRICE_HIGH&category=2&title_search=&rating=4';
    ```

- The `AllProductsSection` component will consist `categoryOptions`. It consists of a list of category option objects with the following properties in each category option object

  | Key         | Data Type |
  | ----------- | --------- |
  | categoryId  | String    |
  | name        | String    |

- The `AllProductsSection` component will consist `ratingOption`. It consists of a list of category rating option objects with the following properties in each rating option object

  | Key       | Data Type |
  | --------- | --------- |
  | ratingId  | String    |
  | imageUrl  | String    |

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being
>   imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a
>   look at the Cheat Sheets.
